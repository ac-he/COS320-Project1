# COS320-Project1
Target Practice Game

Setup instructions from prof.:
    Download and install the appropriate LTS version of Node.js for your system: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
        After installing Node.js, open up a terminal/command prompt and run the command
            npm install --save @types/webgl2
Download and install Webstorm: https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/
        Note that you can verify your status as a student and get a 1-year license rather than a 30-day trial
        After launching Webstorm, go to File -> Settings -> Languages and Frameworks -> Node.js and NPM, and make sure that Webstorm correctly detected your Node.js installation location.
        For convenience, I would recommend also going to the "Typescript" section and checking the box next to "recompile on changes" so that the IDE will alert you of errors as you go.
        There is a "GLSL Support" plugin that you might also want to install now while you're at it.
